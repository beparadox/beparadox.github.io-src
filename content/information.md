## Information
Information is a fundamental concept for any epistemological framework to define and explicate, as it underlies the concepts of knowledge, data, communication and semantics, all properties inherent in the existence of rational, thinking entities. In order to better understand data, it's probably a good place to begin by asking the question "what is information?". I must admit having a weakness for reading Wikipedia to acquire information (which is?...) on topics I'm interested in; I'm not saying it's the best or most accurate source of information (lol again), but it's not a bad place to seed the conversation.

The current Wikipedia entry on information (as of May 20th, 2017) begins by with the following paragraph:

*(1) "Information is that which informs. In other words, it's an answer to a question of some kind."*

A question is formulated using *language*, which itself is generally expressed through auditory or symbolic sequences, which are themselves information. Furthermore, a question, as its generally understood, is driven by a lack of understanding and a need for clarification about something. Why else ask a question but to gain understanding? (1) seems to state that information provides a revelation or clarification to uncertainty.
 
*(2)"It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts".* 

"...data represents values attributed to parameters". Parametric attribution begets values which are essentially data open for interpretation by objects (or agents) endowed with informational-processing capabilties. This is where information intersects with knowledge; "It is thus related to data and knowledge....and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts", understanding being the ability of a cognitive entity to recognize and acceptance relevant data, but also being able to perform processing to return appropriate data (which begs the question as to what constitutes 'relevant' or 'appropriate' data, but such questions can be bypassed for now and returned to later). 

*(3)"At its most fundamental level, information is any propagation of cause and effect within a system".*

Causality is a subject that counntless (actually finite) pages of philosophical hair-splitting have been written about, so this will be kept brief. Any sort of "cause" and it's subsequent "effect" in a system results in some kind of change in state, so is information an inherent characteristic of temporal systems (which is likely redundant; what type of system is atemporal?). A change in state for system is essentially a transformation of objects into a "spatial" arrangement distinct from the previous one; it inevitable must result in the production of new information, at least for anything with the ability to "read" the system, i.e. identify the system's components and distinguish different states of it. So if a change of state occurs, we essentially have a new event taking place, and hence new information to potentially be transmitted through messages. 

At this point it might be useful to look at *information theory*, at least how it was initially formulated.
